      I am a junior software developer at Fundação CERTI (<a href="https://www.certi.org.br/" target="_blank">see
        company's website</a>) since October 2020. I am also a
      master student in Postgraduation program in Pure and Applied Mathematics at Federal
      University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) since March 2020. I and my advisor, professor Leonardo
      Koller Sacht (<a href="http://mtm.ufsc.br/~leo/" target="_blank">see professor's website</a>),
      currently study the areas of <b>Computer Graphics</b> with the goal of defining the topic of
      my masters thesis. In the last months we have studied the areas of Image Processing and Geometry
      Processing. In the moment, we are studying about Statistical Learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond studying for my master's degree, I have been studying programming and related
      areas. Currently, I am taking a <b>JavaScript</b> online course. Also, I have already
      done a <b>Python</b> online course and read the book <b>Clean Code</b>. Furthermore, since I
      installed <b>Linux</b>'s operating system in my personal computer, I have been using
      it daily, as well as <b>git</b>\'s version control system.

      Born in Goiânia, model 96. Fan (or sufferer) of Goiás Esporte Clube. Fan of super heroes
      (have you noticed the references around the website?), Yu-Gi-Oh!, sertanejo and video games.
      I also like cooking and running (despite the fact that I still have not won a competition),
      beyond, of course, programming. Fluent in english and portuguese, my native language. I have also
      already studied germany.

    <h2>Motivaton, development and design</h2>
    <hr class="inlinha" />
    <p>
      My initial motivation for having a website came years ago, when I wanted a place to post
      my <b>LaTeX</b>'s templates to the public. Nowadays my motivation has changed, and my goal
      with the website is to show the world a little of myself and some of my programming skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website was developed using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> with the goal
      of making a SPA (Single Page Application, i.e., there is only a web page and not one for
      each section of the website). I will learn a little about the <b>React</b> library in the next
      months, and I intend to use it or the <b>Vue.js</b> framework in the next version of the
      website, to see the differences of the development using these tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website was entirely developed by me, from the logo to the colors, with exception of the
      images from social networks and from maintenance, which I took or edited. Regarding the colors,
      I wanted to be as simple as possible. The logo's design was based in my passion for Goiás
      Esporte Clube.
